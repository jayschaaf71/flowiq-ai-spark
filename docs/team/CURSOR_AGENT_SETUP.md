# ðŸ¤– **CURSOR AGENT SETUP GUIDE**

## **ðŸ”„ How to Properly Use "Continue Previous Discussion Thread"**

### **Why It Might Not Be Working**
1. **No linked conversation** - The agent might not have a previous thread to continue
2. **Session expired** - Previous conversation might have timed out
3. **Different workspace** - Previous conversation was in a different project
4. **Agent reset** - The agent was reset and lost previous context

### **How to Fix This**

#### **Option 1: Start Fresh with Context**
When starting a new conversation, immediately provide context:
```
"I'm working on the FlowIQ healthcare platform. Here's the current status:

âœ… Application is live and operational
âœ… Team coordination system is established
âœ… Current focus: Platform admin dashboard

Please reference these files for full context:
- docs/team/TEAM_SPRINT_BOARD.md
- docs/team/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md
- docs/team/TEAM_CONTEXT.md

What should I work on next?"
```

#### **Option 2: Use the Template System**
Always use this template when starting new conversations:
```
"I'm continuing from a previous thread. Here's the current status:

âœ… Application is live and operational
âœ… CI/CD pipeline is working
âœ… Team coordination system is established
âœ… Current focus: Practice setup and user onboarding

Please reference these files for context:
- docs/team/TEAM_SPRINT_BOARD.md
- docs/team/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md
- docs/team/TEAM_CONTEXT.md
- CI_CD_STATUS.md

What specific task should I help with today?"
```

### **Best Practice**
- **Always reference** the team files when starting new conversations
- **Provide current status** in the first message
- **Be specific** about what you're working on
- **Ask the AI** to confirm it has the right context
